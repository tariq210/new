        <h1> This is a Ronaldo picture taken from web</h1>
        <img src="ronaldo.jpg" alt="I have copied this image to make a website">
        <h10> His father saw the passion in him for football. His father decided to put him in football academy. When he got to his academy all the boys laughed at him for his short height, broken shoes and dirty clothes. when Ronaldo turned 18 his father died. when they  were being qualified Ronaldo didn't qualify instead his friend did but he said to qualify Ronaldo. When ronaldo was qualified for the national team he became rich day by day. Now he has a big home and a lot of cars.Thank you
